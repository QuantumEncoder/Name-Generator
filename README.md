# Username Generator

This project is a username generator inspired by the Docker name generator concept, aimed at creating unique geeky usernames. It utilizes the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) library to access a comprehensive list of adjectives and nouns, combining them to create a large number of random and unique usernames.

## Technology Stack

- Python
- NLTK
- Streamlit

## What does it do?

The **Username Generator** is a simple application that generates unique usernames. The user interface is built using Streamlit, a Python library used for creating web applications. Upon clicking the "Generate Username" button, the application combines a randomly selected adjective and noun to create a unique username.

## Intended Functionality

The generated usernames can be used for various purposes, including creating unique usernames for online platforms such as GitHub, Gmail, Instagram, and more. For instance, the creator of this project obtained their GitHub username, 'quantumencoder', from this tool.

## Future Improvements

- **Avatar Creation**: The project aims to incorporate functionality for generating avatars using the stable diffusion XL model for the randomly generated usernames.
- **Username Utility Checker**: In the future, the project will include a username utility checker that verifies the availability of the generated username across different platforms, including GitHub, Gmail, Instagram, and various domains.
