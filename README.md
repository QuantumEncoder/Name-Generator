# Docker Username Generator

This Python script generates a random Docker username by combining a random adjective and a random noun. It utilizes the NLTK library to access a list of adjectives and nouns from the WordNet corpus. The generated Docker username is displayed using Streamlit, a web application framework for creating interactive web applications in Python.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have the necessary packages installed. You can install the required packages using the following command:

    ```
    pip install streamlit nltk
    ```

2. Run the script using the following command:

    ```
    streamlit run your_script_name.py
    ```

3. Open the URL displayed in the terminal to view the Docker Username Generator web application.

4. Click the "Generate Docker Username" button to generate a new Docker username.
